## 3. Design


The wireframes for the website can be viewed on Figma at the following link: [Periospot.ai Wireframes](https://www.figma.com/file/emTdZt9i4LSO60OQ3TyYZr/Periospot.ai?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=v1InG5IObQFhxC4S-1)

You can view the high fidelity prototype of the website on Figma at the following link: [Periospot.ai Prototype](https://www.figma.com/file/emTdZt9i4LSO60OQ3TyYZr/Periospot.ai?type=design&node-id=7%3A506&mode=design&t=v1InG5IObQFhxC4S-1)

### 3.1 Design Philosophy
The design of Periospot AI’s web platform is conceptualized to navigate the intersection of technology and dentistry. It is crafted to be as innovative and forward-thinking as the field it represents, aiming to offer insightful and actionable content through an interface that feels both intuitive and enlightening.

### 3.2 Colour Scheme
The colour palette for Periospot AI is carefully chosen to reflect the vibrancy and diversity of AI technology in dentistry. We have selected a combination of vivid and soft tones to create a balance between excitement and sophistication. This includes:

- Dark-grey (#0D0D0D) for a strong, authoritative background in sections like the subscription area.
- Vivid-yellow (#F1AC3C) to symbolize innovation, used primarily for the Research section and interactive buttons.
- Vivid-red (#E01D1F) and Vivid-blue (#086CC1) to denote urgency and trust, used for New Technology and AI Videos sections respectively.
- Soft-grey (#ECECEC) and Dark-blue (#023462) as complementary colours to add depth and contrast.
These colours are not only aesthetically pleasing but also pass accessibility standards, ensuring readability and inclusivity.

![Colour Palette](docs/README_Images/Color_Pallete.png)

### 3.3 Typography
Our typography choices are intended to merge clarity with personality. We use the 'Darker Grotesque' font family, a modern and versatile typeface that scales beautifully across devices. The varying weights from light to bold are utilized to create a hierarchy of information and draw attention to different sections of the content.

- Headings are bold and assertive, with 'Darker Grotesque Extra Bold' for primary headings to anchor each section with confidence.
- The body text is rendered in 'Darker Grotesque Regular', ensuring legibility and ease of reading for longer paragraphs.

![Typography](docs/README_Images/Font-family.png)

### Layout and Structure
Periospot AI’s layout is strategically structured to facilitate the user journey from discovery through to engagement:

- The homepage serves as a gateway, featuring a dynamic hero section that encapsulates the essence of AI in dentistry, leading to curated featured content that showcases the latest studies and innovations.
- The Featured Content page is a grid of cards, each a portal to detailed articles and resources, signifying the breadth of information available.
- The About Us & Contact page introduces the team behind Periospot AI, building trust and opening channels for communication through an intuitive contact form.
- The navigation is straightforward, with a top navigation bar that is consistent across pages. Each section is designed to ensure users can find information with ease and are encouraged to explore deeper into the content.

The mobile-responsive design ensures that the experience is seamless on any device, with cards and content blocks realigning themselves to fit narrower screens without compromising on usability or visual appeal.

### Performance

Chapter 1: The Wake-Up Call

The initial Lighthouse report delivered a stark reality: the Periospot AI homepage was underperforming, with a score of 70 in Performance. The primary culprit? Oversized images that were bulky, slowing down page loads and affecting user experience negatively.

![Initial Lighthouse Report](docs/README_Images/validation/Lighthouse/lighthouse_home.png)

Chapter 2: The Optimization Quest

The journey began with resizing images, converting them to more efficient formats like WebP using the cwebp tool. This crucial step reduced bytes and improved loading times dramatically, exemplified by the significant decrease in the potential savings after the conversion.

![Image Optimization](docs/README_Images/validation/Lighthouse/issues1.png)

Chapter 3: The Rise in Performance

The featured content page's performance soared to a 93 score after the image optimizations. Larger Contentful Paint and Cumulative Layout Shift numbers indicated that the website was becoming more responsive and visually stable.

![Featured Page Performance](docs/README_Images/validation/Lighthouse/Lighthouse_featured.png)

Chapter 4: Tackling the Core Issues

Next, the focus turned to render-blocking resources and inefficient cache policies. Refinements were made to the site's cache-loading strategies, along with adjustments to how resources were loaded and scripts were deferred, leading to an even smoother user experience.

![Core Issues](docs/README_Images/validation/Lighthouse/issues2.png)

Chapter 5: The Final Frontier

The contact page faced its own set of challenges, from lazy-loaded images to cache policy inefficiencies. But with diligent application of best practices, the page performance experienced an uptick, moving closer to perfection.

![Contact Page Performance](docs/README_Images/validation/Lighthouse/Lighthousecontactsok.png)

Epilogue: A Speedier Web Experience

As the curtain falls on this optimization odyssey, the Periospot AI website emerges leaner and faster. The final Lighthouse reports glow green with scores in the high 90s, a testament to the meticulous efforts in performance enhancement.

# Bugs and Future Implementations

Bug / Future Implementation | Description
--- | ---
Missing server.js file | Initially, we were trying to run a server.js file that didn't exist in our project directory. This was causing Node.js to throw a MODULE_NOT_FOUND error. We identified this issue and advised to create a server.js file.
MailerLite integration | We were trying to integrate MailerLite into our project for handling newsletter subscriptions. We provided a basic example of how we could set up a server-side script to handle POST requests from our client-side script and interact with the MailerLite API.
Server not starting | After setting up the server.js file and .env file, we tried to start our server with the node server.js command, but didn't see the expected output ("Server running on port 3000"). We suggested several things to check, including the location of our .env file, the format of our environment variables, and the installation of necessary Node.js packages.
MailerLite implementation | Despite our efforts, we were not able to solve the issue with starting the server. This could be due to a variety of factors, such as a problem with our Node.js installation, a misconfiguration in our system, or an issue with the MailerLite API key or group ID. Without more information, it's difficult to determine the exact cause of the problem. We decided to fake the success in subscription for now and leave the full MailerLite implementation to the next stage of our project.
