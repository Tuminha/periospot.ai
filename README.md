### Design Philosophy
The design of Periospot AI’s web platform is conceptualized to navigate the intersection of technology and dentistry. It is crafted to be as innovative and forward-thinking as the field it represents, aiming to offer insightful and actionable content through an interface that feels both intuitive and enlightening.

### Colour Scheme
The colour palette for Periospot AI is carefully chosen to reflect the vibrancy and diversity of AI technology in dentistry. We have selected a combination of vivid and soft tones to create a balance between excitement and sophistication. This includes:

- Dark-grey (#0D0D0D) for a strong, authoritative background in sections like the subscription area.
- Vivid-yellow (#F1AC3C) to symbolize innovation, used primarily for the Research section and interactive buttons.
- Vivid-red (#E01D1F) and Vivid-blue (#086CC1) to denote urgency and trust, used for New Technology and AI Videos sections respectively.
- Soft-grey (#ECECEC) and Dark-blue (#023462) as complementary colours to add depth and contrast.
These colours are not only aesthetically pleasing but also pass accessibility standards, ensuring readability and inclusivity.

### Typography
Our typography choices are intended to merge clarity with personality. We use the 'Darker Grotesque' font family, a modern and versatile typeface that scales beautifully across devices. The varying weights from light to bold are utilized to create a hierarchy of information and draw attention to different sections of the content.

- Headings are bold and assertive, with 'Darker Grotesque Extra Bold' for primary headings to anchor each section with confidence.
- The body text is rendered in 'Darker Grotesque Regular', ensuring legibility and ease of reading for longer paragraphs.

### Layout and Structure
Periospot AI’s layout is strategically structured to facilitate the user journey from discovery through to engagement:

- The homepage serves as a gateway, featuring a dynamic hero section that encapsulates the essence of AI in dentistry, leading to curated featured content that showcases the latest studies and innovations.
- The Featured Content page is a grid of cards, each a portal to detailed articles and resources, signifying the breadth of information available.
- The About Us & Contact page introduces the team behind Periospot AI, building trust and opening channels for communication through an intuitive contact form.
- The navigation is straightforward, with a top navigation bar that is consistent across pages. Each section is designed to ensure users can find information with ease and are encouraged to explore deeper into the content.

The mobile-responsive design ensures that the experience is seamless on any device, with cards and content blocks realigning themselves to fit narrower screens without compromising on usability or visual appeal.
